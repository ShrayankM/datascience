Data Science  
===========
A collection of scripts in Python, R and Matlab/Octave.
Since March 11th 2020 I have started to develop a [jupyter 
notebook](https://github.com/luigiselmi/datascience/blob/master/python/covid19-monitoring-notebook.ipynb) in Python to monitor the 
spread of the covid-19 virus for
some european countries.
