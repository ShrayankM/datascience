    "# Edges and contours\n",
    "Edges are sets of pixels whose value changes remarkably along a particular orientation. The amount of change is represented by the first derivative of the intensity. Since the intensity is not a continuous function we must compute the derivative as the ratio of the difference between two pixel values along one direction, e.g. the horizontal direction $\\vec{i}$, to the distance between the two pixels.\n",

    "We can do the same to compute the first derivative along the vertical direction $\\vec{j}$ and define the image gradient \n",
