    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique for unsupervised exploratory data analysis. It is used to reduce the dimensions of the observations' space so that the main components, represented as linear combinations of the original predictors, can be represented in a space of lower dimensions. If p is the number of predictors, we can represent the first principal component of the $i^{th}$ observation as \n",
