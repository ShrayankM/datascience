## Welcome to Data Science

This repository contains code, mostly Jupyter notebooks, about data science and statistical inference. The main projects are

 - [covid19 monitoring notebook](python/covid19/covid19-monitoring-notebook.ipynb) is a single notebook in python that monitors the >
    virus in some European countries.
 - [Statistical Learning](r/stat_learning/chapter1.ipynb) is a collection of notebooks in R with my notes about a course on
statistical inference and worked out examples taken from the book used in the course.
 - [Bayesian Inference](r/rethinking/probability.ipynb) is a collection
of notes about probability and bayesian inference and R scripts taken
from the books I am using for this project.
- [copernicus](python/copernicus/copernicus_services.ipynb) notebooks about climate change using the Copernicus
data.
- [digital image processing](python/imaging/digital_image_processing.ipynb) notebooks about digital image processing
